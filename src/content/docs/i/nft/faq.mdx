Common questions about NFT minting and troubleshooting when issues arise.

## Basic Questions

### Q: What is an NFT?

NFT (Non-Fungible Token) is technology that proves ownership of digital data. Recording on the blockchain guarantees the uniqueness and ownership of your artwork.

### Q: What does "minting" mean?

Recording your artwork as an NFT on the blockchain. The term comes from "minting" coins.

### Q: Can I undo a minted NFT?

No. NFTs recorded on the blockchain cannot be undone. Review carefully before minting.

### Q: What happens to the NFT if I edit the artwork?

The NFT contains the original image data. Even if you edit the artwork on CLOSM i, the NFT image remains unchanged.

## Wallet Questions

### Q: Can I use wallets other than MetaMask?

Currently, CLOSM i supports MetaMask and WalletConnect-compatible wallets.

### Q: Can I change my wallet address?

Yes. You can disconnect your current wallet on the NFT page and connect a new one. However, already minted NFTs remain associated with the original wallet address.

### Q: Will connecting a wallet cost money?

No. Wallet connection alone incurs no fees. Gas fees are required when executing a mint.
