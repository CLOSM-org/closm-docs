CLOSM i provides a **test environment separate from production**.

In the test environment, you can experience NFT minting **without using real money**.

---

## What is the Test Environment?

The test environment is prepared for feature verification and practice before production release.

### Test Environment URL

```
https://dev.i.closm.llc
