## Common Questions

### Q: If I upgrade mid-month, what happens to my limits?

The new plan's limits apply immediately. Already used counts remain counted.

### Q: What happens when I reach the limit?

You cannot mint until the next month's reset on the 1st. There is no option to purchase additional mints.

### Q: What if I downgrade?

Already minted NFTs are not affected. From the next month, the new plan's limits apply.

### Q: Are Polygon and Base counted separately?

Yes. Each chain is counted individually. On Lite plan, you can mint Polygon 3 + Base 3 = 6 total mints.
