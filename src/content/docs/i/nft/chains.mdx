## Choosing a Chain

### Start with Polygon or Base

For your first NFT mint, we recommend trying Polygon or Base:

- Minimal loss if something goes wrong
- Quick results
- Same display on OpenSea

### When to Choose Ethereum

Consider Ethereum when:

- Planning high-value sales
- Appealing to Ethereum collectors
- Integrating with specific Ethereum NFT collections

---

## OpenSea Display

NFTs from any chain are viewable and tradeable on OpenSea.

### How to Check

1. Go to [OpenSea](https://opensea.io)
2. Log in with MetaMask
3. Profile → "Collected" to view your NFTs

### Switching Chains

On OpenSea, you can filter by chain:

- Select "Polygon", "Ethereum", or "Base" in filters
- View NFTs from all chains

## Common Questions

### Q: Can I change the chain later?

No. Once minted, NFTs cannot be moved to another chain. Choose carefully before minting.

### Q: Can I mint the same artwork on multiple chains?

No. One artwork can only be minted as an NFT on one chain.

### Q: Are Polygon or Base NFTs less valuable?

Value is determined by the artwork and demand, not the chain. Polygon and Base NFTs are actively traded.

### Q: Which is better, Base or Polygon?

Both are low-cost and fast. If you already have MATIC, use Polygon. If you have ETH, use Base.
