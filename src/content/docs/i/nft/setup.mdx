To mint NFTs, you need a crypto wallet and gas fees (transaction fees).

## What is a Wallet?

A wallet is a tool for managing NFTs and assets on the blockchain. CLOSM i recommends **MetaMask**.

:::note
Never share your wallet's private key or seed phrase with anyone. Losing these can result in loss of assets.
:::

---

## Installing MetaMask

### 1. Installation

Install the browser extension from the [official MetaMask website](https://metamask.io).

Supported browsers:
- Chrome
- Firefox
- Brave
- Edge

### 2. Creating a Wallet

1. Open the MetaMask extension
2. Select "Create a new wallet"
3. Set a password
4. **Safely record and store** your seed phrase (12 words)

:::caution[Seed Phrase Management]
Write down your seed phrase on paper and store it in a safe place. If storing digitally, encryption is recommended.
:::

### 3. Network Configuration

CLOSM i uses the following networks:

| Network | Use |
|---------|-----|
| Polygon | Low-cost minting (recommended) |
| Ethereum | Mainnet minting |

MetaMask connects to Ethereum mainnet by default. For Polygon, additional setup is needed, but CLOSM i's NFT page will prompt you to switch networks automatically during minting.

## Preparing Gas Fees

### What are Gas Fees?

Fees required to execute transactions on the blockchain. These are needed when minting NFTs.

### Required Currency

| Chain | Currency | Estimated Amount |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| Polygon | MATIC | 0.01–0.1 MATIC |
| Ethereum | ETH | 0.001–0.01 ETH |

:::tip
Gas fees fluctuate based on network congestion. Check the actual estimate on the NFT page.
:::

### How to Obtain

You can obtain MATIC or ETH through:

1. **Purchase at a crypto exchange**
   - Buy ETH at exchanges (Coinbase, Binance, etc.)
   - Get MATIC via bridge or supported exchanges

2. **Transfer from another wallet**
   - Send to your MetaMask address
