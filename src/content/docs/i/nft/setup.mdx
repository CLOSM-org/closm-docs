To mint NFTs, you need a crypto wallet and gas fees (transaction fees).

## What is a Wallet?

A wallet is a tool for managing NFTs and assets on the blockchain.

### Supported Wallets

CLOSM i supports the following wallets:

| Wallet | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| **MetaMask** | Most popular browser extension wallet (recommended) |
| **WalletConnect-compatible wallets** | Rainbow, Trust Wallet, etc. |

:::note
Never share your wallet's private key or seed phrase with anyone. Losing these can result in loss of assets.
:::

## Installing MetaMask

### 1. Installation

Install the browser extension from the [official MetaMask website](https://metamask.io).

Supported browsers:
- Chrome
- Firefox
- Brave
- Edge

### 2. Creating a Wallet

1. Open the MetaMask extension
2. Select "Create a new wallet"
3. Set a password
4. **Safely record and store** your seed phrase (12 words)

:::caution[Seed Phrase Management]
Write down your seed phrase on paper and store it in a safe place. If storing digitally, encryption is recommended.
:::

### 3. Network Configuration

CLOSM i uses the following networks:

| Network | Use | Gas Currency |
|:--------|:----|:-------------|
| Polygon | Low-cost minting (recommended) | MATIC |
| Ethereum | Mainnet minting | ETH |
| Base | Low-cost minting | ETH |

MetaMask connects to Ethereum mainnet by default. For Polygon or Base, additional setup is needed, but CLOSM i's NFT page will prompt you to switch networks automatically during minting.
